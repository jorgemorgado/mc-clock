# mc-clock

## Description

Simple Mission Control clock. Can be used to display the current time on 3
different cities. Can run completely disconnected (client-side only).

I've created this to be used on a Mission Control dashboard around mid-2011.
Maybe you can find other use(s) for this mini-project.

## Usage

Just download the files and open `index.html` (should work fine on most modern
web browsers). You can also fetch the files from a remote web-server.

By default, the MC-Clock will show a clock for ZÃ¼rich, New York and Sydney.
If you want other cities, check the function `doClock()` in the file
`digitalclock.js`.

Also check the file `worldclock.js` for examples of other cities (at the
bottom).
